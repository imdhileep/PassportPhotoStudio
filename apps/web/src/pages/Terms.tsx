      <p>
        Passport Photo Studio provides tools that assist with creating passport-style photos, but you are responsible for
        confirming compliance with your local government or agency. Requirements can change by country and application
        type. Always verify the latest official guidelines before submitting.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. We strive to deliver accurate cropping, sizing,
        and background removal, but we cannot guarantee acceptance by every authority. You agree to use the tool at your
        own discretion and to keep a backup of your original photo.
      </p>
      <p>
        All intellectual property associated with the site, including design, branding, and code, remains the property
        of Passport Photo Studio. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive license to use the service for personal or
        business-related photo preparation. You may not copy, resell, or reverse engineer the service without permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to use this service. If you are using Passport Photo Studio on behalf of
        another person, you confirm that you have permission to process their photo and that you are acting within your
        local laws and regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may not use the service for unlawful activities, deceptive submissions, or to create fraudulent identity
        documents. We reserve the right to restrict access if we detect misuse or abuse of the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The service may include third-party tools such as analytics or optional advertising. By using the site, you agree
        to those tools operating as described in our Privacy Policy. We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability, and
        scheduled maintenance or outages may occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Passport Photo Studio and its operators are not liable for any indirect,
        incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the service. This includes application delays,
        rejected submissions, or costs associated with reprints.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refunds are not offered for the free service. If paid features are introduced, refund eligibility will be
        described at the time of purchase. We may update these terms periodically, and continued use of the service
        indicates acceptance of the updated terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        These terms are governed by the laws applicable to the operator of Passport Photo Studio. If any provision is
        found unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue in full effect.
